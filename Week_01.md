## Guidance

Answer the following questions considering the learning outcomes for

- [Week 01](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/developer/week01-project01-basics/learning-outcomes/)
  
Make sure to record evidence of your processes. You can use code snippets, screenshots or any other material to support your answers.

Do not fill in the feedback section. The Founders and Coders team will update this with feedback on your progress.

Assessment
1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.
* Structure a site using semantic HTML to aid accessibility
  - deployed website with named html elements
* Ensure a web page is readable for screen readers
  - used semantic HTML and also created tailored contact buttons designed with screen readers in mind with contact names.
*  Ensure our UI has sufficient colour contrast so that everyone can perceive it comfortably
  - checked colour contrast rates against WCGA standards
* Use various tools to check that our website meets accessibility criteria
  - used lighthouse audit
 
* Use CSS grid/ Flexbox
  - used dynamic html inputs from hooked up DB to fill out about page contact details
 
* Ensure Git commit history tells coherent story
  - Used relevant commit messages, rebases where necessary for linear history
  - Used user stories to formulate project tickets
 
Other 
* Explored info passing with url query parameters
* Deployed dynamic data with JSON
* Deployed dynamic data with Supabase
* Deployed DB triggers and RSL for info security
* Deployed EC2


2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
* CI/CD deployment
 - Went through various iterations of gh actions. Issue with cycled github runner addresses led to looking into aws SSM and idps.
 - Established connection with IdP method but not deployment, able to run SSM commands but not via gh actions. 

* Best practices on website deployment
  - would like to revisit https deployment, look into load management etc. 


Feedback (For CF's)

Alexander

[What went well]

You covered all the basics and many more. You have a good understanding of git workflow and the basics of a basic static website. It was great that you added some JSON manipulation and even connected to Supabase.

[Even better if]

It would be great if you could add some brief code snippets to support your learnings. You could also mention GitHub Projects and a bit of project planning. No need to amend this week, you can add it on week02. A screenshot of the Gantt Diagram would be great.
