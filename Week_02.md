## Assessment
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.

* Write code that executes asynchronously

* Use callbacks to access values that arenâ€™t available synchronously
* Use the fetch method to make HTTP requests and receive responses
* Configure the options argument of the fetch method to make GET and POST requests
* Understand server-side development using Node.js.
```javascript
async function ask(prompt) {
  const fetch = (await import('node-fetch')).default;
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/generate-response', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ message: prompt }),  
    });

    const data = await response.json();

    if (data.error) {
      throw new Error(data.error); 
    }

    return data.response;  
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error communicating with Python backend:', error);
    return 'Sorry, something went wrong while processing your request.';
  }
}

module.exports = { ask };
```

* Set up a Node.js environment for web development
* Use environment variables for managing secrets and sensitive keys in Node.js
* Use npm to manage project dependencies and scripts in a Node.js environment.

 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.

Testing! Few examples of implemented testing frameworks in the project.
